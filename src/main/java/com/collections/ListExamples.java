/*
    Java Parallel Streams is a feature of Java 8 and higher, meant for utilizing multiple cores of
    the processor. Normally any java code has one stream of processing, where it is executed sequentially.
    Whereas by using parallel streams, we can divide the code into multiple streams that are executed
    in parallel on separate cores and the final result is the combination of the individual outcomes.
    The order of execution, however, is not under our control.

    Therefore, it is advisable to use parallel streams in cases where no matter what is the order of execution,
    the result is unaffected and the state of one element does not affect the other as well as the source
    of the data also remains unaffected.
